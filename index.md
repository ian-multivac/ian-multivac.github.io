## Latest Projects

### Displaying Local Airport Departures

A colleague described an interesting project, and I set out to see how N8N could potentially provide a way to maintain a display of local airport departures.  Walk through the solution on [the project page](projects/automations.md).

### Generative AI-based Personal Assistant

A gift to a colleague; a project tutorial is coming soon.

### Todo Sync iOS Extension

A Pythonista 3 script that parses text files and creates ClickUp tasks and iOS reminders for any flagged text.  Perfect for sifting through dozens of WIP projects!  [Visit the project page here.](projects/pythonista-todo.md)
