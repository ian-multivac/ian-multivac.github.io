# Other Websites

Over the last while, several other domains have been included in the myMultivac portfolio.  In order to explore some unfamiliar tools and processes, myMultivac expanded to allow a quick and dirty way to spin up a basic static site using Firebase hosting.  Each site is tied with Google Analytics, and also relates to other explorations.

## You Got Jammed

I use this .gif way too often, and decided it needed a dedicated domain for it.  Visit [yougotjammed.com](https://www.yougotjammed.com) if you really feel like it.

## Coffee Trouble

Inspired by a Startup Name Generator tool that I stumbled across when looking for something completely different, [coffeetrouble.com](https://www.coffeetrouble.com) was an expensive one-off HTML joke.  

## Scungle

Because the horngus of a dongfish is attached by a scungle to a kind of dillsack, [scungle.com](https://www.scungle.com) is a placeholder for the time being.  It will be used to manage custom connectors between sites, including external and social authorization.

## Drytindr

An AI-generated site template created using a prompt "a dating site that the Golden Girls would use", [drytindr.com](https://www.drytindr.com) is a parody dating site.  It will be a complete mock of a dating site, including self-contained bot users with some demo visibility.

## Jeann.ai

An generative AI chatbot that helps answer questions from a public knowledge base.  This started as a joke, but quickly turned into an incredibly useful bot, and was surprisingly easy to build.  [Jeann.ai](https://jeann.ai) uses N8N to manage two versions of the bot: one that can be accessed through an embedded widget on the site above, and another that can be integrated easily into Slack to help answer questions in a private environment.
